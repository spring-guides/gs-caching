This guide walks you through the process of enabling caching on a Spring managed bean.

== What you'll build

You'll build an application that enables caching on a simple book repository.


== What you'll need

:java_version: 1.8
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/prereq_editor_jdk_buildtools.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/how_to_complete_this_guide.adoc[]

[[initial]]
== Create a book repository

First, let's create a very simple model for your book

`src/main/java/hello/Book.java`
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/hello/Book.java[]
----

And a repository for that model:

`src/main/java/hello/BookRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/hello/BookRepository.java[]
----

You could have used {SpringData}[Spring Data] to provide an implementation of your
repository over a wide range of SQL or NoSQL stores, but for the purpose of this
guide, you will simply use a naive implementation that simulates some latency
(network service, slow delay, etc).

`src/main/java/hello/SimpleBookRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/hello/SimpleBookRepository.java[]
----

`simulateSlowService` is deliberately inserting a three second delay into each `getByIsbn` call. This is an example that later on, you'll speed up with caching.

== Using the repository
Next, wire up the repository and use it to access some books.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/spring-boot-application.adoc[]

There is also a {runner}[`CommandLineRunner`] that injects the `BookRepository` and calls it several times with different arguments.

`src/main/java/hello/AppRunner.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/AppRunner.java[]
----

If you try to run the application at this point, you'll notice it's quite slow even though you are retrieving
the exact same book several times.

----
2014-06-05 12:15:35.783  ... : .... Fetching books
2014-06-05 12:15:40.783  ... : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
2014-06-05 12:15:43.784  ... : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
2014-06-05 12:15:46.786  ... : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
----

As can be seen by the timestamps, each book took about three seconds to retrieve, even though it's the same title being repeatedly fetched.

== Enable caching

Let's enable caching on your `SimpleBookRepository` so that the books are cached within
the `books` cache.

`src/main/java/hello/SimpleBookRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/SimpleBookRepository.java[]
----

You now need to enable the processing of the caching annotations

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

The {EnableCaching}[`@EnableCaching`] annotation triggers a post processor that
inspects every Spring bean for the presence of caching annotations on public
methods. If such an annotation is found, a proxy is automatically created to intercept
the method call and handle the caching behavior accordingly.

The annotations that are managed by this post processor are {Cacheable}[`Cacheable`],
{CachePut}[`CachePut`] and {CacheEvict}[`CacheEvict`]. You can refer to the javadocs and
{documentation}[the documentation] for more details.

Spring Boot automatically configures a suitable {CacheManager}[`CacheManager`] to serve as
a provider for the relevant cache. See {bootcaching}[the Spring Boot documentation] for more details.

Our sample does not use a specific caching library so our cache store is the simple fallback that uses `ConcurrentHashMap`. The caching abstraction supports a wide range of cache library and is fully compliant with JSR-107 (JCache).

== Test the application

Now that caching is enabled, you can execute it again and see the difference by adding additional
calls with or without the same isbn. It should make a huge difference.

----
2016-09-01 11:12:47.033  .. : .... Fetching books
2016-09-01 11:12:50.039  .. : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
2016-09-01 11:12:53.044  .. : isbn-4567 -->Book{isbn='isbn-4567', title='Some book'}
2016-09-01 11:12:53.045  .. : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
2016-09-01 11:12:53.045  .. : isbn-4567 -->Book{isbn='isbn-4567', title='Some book'}
2016-09-01 11:12:53.045  .. : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
2016-09-01 11:12:53.045  .. : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
----

This excerpt from the console shows that the first time to fetch each title took three seconds, but each subsequent call was near instantaneous.


== Summary

Congratulations! You've just enabled caching on a Spring managed bean.
